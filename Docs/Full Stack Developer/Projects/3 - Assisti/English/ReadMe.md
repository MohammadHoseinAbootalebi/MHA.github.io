### **Requirement Analysis & Architecture Planning**

ChatGPT Note:

* Understand the functional and technical requirements.
* Plan the backend architecture (e.g., APIs, databases).
* Decide on the technology stack (e.g., frontend framework, backend language, database).

#### Database Architecture

As Assisti is a multidisciplinary project that combines full-stack development and artificial intelligence engineering, its database schema includes several models with a common label field that should be predicted by the Assisti AI models. The following section shows the Assisti database schema:

![Assisti Database Schema](../Assets/Database%20Schema/Assisti.png)

The core Assisti database tables are categorized into the following sections:

* **Assisti Chat Models**
* **Users**
* **NLP Models**
* **Classifiers**
* **Self-Driving Automobile Models**

In the following, the sub-tables of each section will be explained:

* **Users** : This table is used to store general user information and to manage authentication and authorization processes.
  * *Tables:*
    * **Auth User:** This object model will primarily be used for authentication and authorization.
      * **Name:** This is the user's full name.
      * **Email:** This field is designated for the user's email.
      * **Username:** This field is designated for the user's username.
      * **Joined Date:** This field is designated for the user's join date and time.
      * **Is Active:** This field indicates whether the user account is active.
      * **Is Verified:** This field indicates whether the user account has a verified email address.
      * **Is Staff:** This field indicates whether this profile belongs to Assisit staff.
      * **ID:** This is the unique ID of this user object model.
    * **Profile:** Till adding the profile object model information.
