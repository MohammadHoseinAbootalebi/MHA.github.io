As previously explained in the Assisti database schema section, the Auth User backend database model contains following attributes:

* **Email**
  * `email = models.EmailField(_('email address'), unique=True)`
  * Stores the email address of the user, ensuring uniqueness in the system.
* **Username**
  * `username = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True, null=True, unique=True, default=generate_random_username)`
  * Stores the username of the user, with a maximum length of 150 characters. It is unique and defaults to a randomly generated value if not provided.
* **Name**
  * `name = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)`
  * Stores the user's name, with a maximum length of 100 characters. This field is optional.
* **Date Joined**
  * `date_joined = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, null=True, blank=True)`
  * Automatically records the date and time when the user account was created.
* **Is Active**
  * `is_active = models.BooleanField(default=False)`
  * Indicates whether the user account is active. Default is `False`.
* **Is Verified**
  * `is_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)`
  * Indicates whether the user's email address has been verified. Default is `False`.
* **Is Staff**
  * `is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)`
  * Determines whether the user has staff privileges. Default is `False`.
* **Two-Factor Code**
  * `two_factor_code = models.CharField(max_length=6, blank=True, null=True)`
  * Stores the user's two-factor authentication code, if applicable, with a maximum length of 6 characters.
* **ID**
  * `id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)`
  * Serves as the unique identifier for the user, using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).

##### Profile

Upon successfully creating an Assisti user account, a unique profile object is automatically generated. This profile serves various purposes, including frontend display, email notifications, participation in Assisti chatrooms, and more. The backend structure of the profile object model is as follows:

#### API Development

Not added yet.

#### Authentication & Authorization

To create a robust and scalable backend with a focus on extensibility and security, the Assisti backend was developed using the powerful Django framework and Python programming language. Djangoâ€™s versatility allows for rapid development, while its built-in security features ensure data protection and minimize vulnerabilities. Python's simplicity and efficiency further enhance the backend's performance, making it easier to maintain and expand as the application grows. This combination of technologies ensures that the backend can handle increased user traffic and new feature integrations seamlessly. Additionally, the flexible architecture supports continuous improvements, positioning the Assisti backend for long-term success and adaptability.

##### Assisti Auth User Database Model

To ensure extensibility, a key characteristic envisioned for Assisti, the development of the backend user models was carefully designed with scalability and flexibility in mind. The following base code serves as the foundation for the Assisti user model, allowing for seamless customization and integration of additional features as needed. By implementing a modular architecture, the user model can accommodate future enhancements without disrupting the core functionality. This approach not only simplifies maintenance but also aligns with the project's goal of supporting evolving user requirements. The base code exemplifies this commitment to adaptability and forward-thinking design.

ðŸ“Œ One of my core strengths is writing clean, well-structured, and fully documented code, ensuring readability and ease of understanding for seamless collaboration and future maintenance.

In Django development, extending the user authentication model is best achieved by creating custom user models that inherit from `AbstractBaseUser`. This approach provides greater flexibility for future enhancements and customizations. I have implemented this key feature, ensuring the user model is robust, scalable, and adaptable to evolving project needs. By following this best practice, the backend is better positioned for seamless integration of advanced functionalities. This implementation highlights my focus on building maintainable and forward-thinking solutions.

As demonstrated in the Assisti code above, the `AssistIUser`, a customized Django backend user model, includes the following attributes designed to enhance functionality and adaptability.

* **Email:** This field stores the email addresses of Assisti users, serving as a cornerstone for authentication and authorization processes. Recognized as the "email address" in the admin panel, it is designed to be unique, ensuring every user has an exclusive identifier. Beyond authentication, this email is integral to various platform functionalities, including subscription services, successful payment confirmations, and other critical notifications. Most importantly, it supports secure login through cutting-edge two-factor authentication, where verification codes are sent via emailâ€”a widely adopted standard in modern authentication systems across platforms.
* **Username:** This field is used to store the username, which increases the uniqueness of Assisti users and allows for potential future use cases.
* **Name:** This field displays the names of Assisti users.
* **Date Joined:** This field records the date and time when each Assisti user joined the platform.
* **Is Active:** This field indicates whether an Assisti user's account is active or not.
* **Is Verified:** This field indicates whether an Assisti user has verified their email address.
* **Is Staff:** This field checks whether an Assisti user is a staff member or an employee of Assisti.
* **Two-Factor Code:** This field stores the two-factor authentication code, which enhances Assisti's authentication and authorization system.
* **ID:** This field serves as the unique identifier for each Assisti user.
* **Objects:** This field specifies the customized Assisti manager responsible for user creation and superuser creation processes.

##### Two-Factor Authentication System

To enhance the security of user authentication in the Assisti project, an optional two-factor authentication (2FA) method has been implemented. This approach involves generating a fixed-length random code, which is sent to the user's email address. During the login process, after the user enters his/her email, they are prompted to provide the two-factor authentication code received in their inbox. This additional step ensures that only the rightful owner of the email account can access the system, adding a significant layer of protection to the login process.
