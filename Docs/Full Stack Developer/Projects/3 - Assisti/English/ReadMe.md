ChatGPT Note:

* Understand the functional and technical requirements.
* Plan the backend architecture (e.g., APIs, databases).
* Decide on the technology stack (e.g., frontend framework, backend language, database).

#### Database Architecture

As Assisti is a multidisciplinary project that combines full-stack development and artificial intelligence engineering, its database schema includes several models with a common label field that should be predicted by the Assisti AI models. The following section shows the Assisti database schema:

![Assisti Database Schema](../Assets/Database%20Schema/Assisti.png)

The core Assisti database tables are categorized into the following sections:

* **Assisti Chat Models**
* **Users**
* **NLP Models**
* **Classifiers**
* **Self-Driving Automobile Models**

In the following, the sub-tables of each section will be explained:

* **Users** : This table is used to store general user information and to manage authentication and authorization processes.
  * *Tables:*
    * **Auth User:** This object model will primarily be used for authentication and authorization.
      * Database fields:
        * **Name:** This is the user's full name.
        * **Email:** This field is designated for the user's email.
        * **Username:** This field is designated for the user's username.
        * **Joined Date:** This field is designated for the user's join date and time.
        * **Is Active:** This field indicates whether the user account is active.
        * **Is Verified:** This field indicates whether the user account has a verified email address.
        * **Is Staff:** This field indicates whether this profile belongs to Assisit staff.
        * **ID:** This is the unique ID of this user object model.
    * **Profile:** This is model will be used for Authencticated and authorization user's profile.
      * Database fields:
        * **Profile Owner:** This is a one-to-one relationship with the Auth user model field.
        * **Name:** This is the profile model name.
        * **Email:** This is the profile model email, which is the same as the authentication email.
        * **Username:** This is the profile model username, which is the same as the authentication username.
        * **Biography:** This is the profile model biography.
        * **Creation Date and Time:** This is the profile model creation date and time.
        * **ID:** This is the profile model unique id.
* **Assisti Chat Models:** This section of the Assisti database is dedicated to the Assisti chatbot, which the end-user can interact with for various purposes, such as summarizing, grammar checking, practicing English or other languages, asking scientific questions, assisting with coding, and more.
  * *Tables:*
    * **Message:** This message table contains each message that will be sent to the Assisti chatbot.
      * Database fields:
        * **Owner:** This is the authenticated user who sends each message object model. Therefore, it has a many-to-one relationship with the Auth User model.
        * **Category:** This is the category to which this message is related. It has a many-to-one relationship with the Category model.
        * **Message:** This is the message body that the authenticated user sends to the Assisti chatbot.
        * **Answer:** This is the answer that the Assisti bot will provide in response to this message.
        * **Creation Date and Time:** This is the message model creation date and time.
        * **ID:** This is the message model unique id.
    * **Category:** This database table is dedicated to the message categories that Assisti end-users can use to ask the Assisti chatbot messages in different categories, or 'chatrooms.' This feature of Assisti is similar to ChatGPT by OpenAI.
      * Database fields:
        * **Owner:** This is the authenticated user who creates different message categories. It has a many-to-one relationship with the Auth User model.
        * **Name:** This is the category name text field for this table.
        * **Creation Date and Time:** This is the category model creation date and time.
        * **ID:** This is the category model unique id.
* **NLP Models:** This section of the Assisti Super Artificial Intelligence project is dedicated to designing the database tables used in artificial intelligence models, primarily focused on the field of natural language processing.
  * Tables:
    * **OCR Model:** This table is dedicated to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model in the Assisti.
      * Database fields:
        * **Owner:** This refers to the owner or creator of the object model, which is the Assisti Auth User. It has a many-to-one relationship with the Auth User model.
        * **Title:** This is the title of each created object model, provided by the user.
        * **Image:** This is the OCR image uploaded by the user, intended to be processed by the Assisti OCR application.
        * **Label:** This is the label associated with the image, predicted by the Assisti OCR application, with the extracted text saved in this field.
        * **Creation Date and Time:** This represents the date and time when the OCR model was created.
        * **ID:** This is the unique identifier for the OCR model.
* **Classifiers:** Till adding the classifiers description.
