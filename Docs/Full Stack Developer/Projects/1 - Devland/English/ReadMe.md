### **Wireframing**

Wireframing, or low-level design, plays a crucial role in project development by serving as the foundational blueprint of the final product. This process focuses on visualizing the overall structure of the project in its simplest form, providing clarity on how various components interconnect. By starting with a broad overview, wireframing allows for a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope and functionality. Each section is subsequently broken down into smaller, clearly defined design elements, ensuring that even complex systems are presented in an intuitive and easily comprehensible manner. The low-level design of the Devand project demonstrates this approach, offering a streamlined representation of its structure that facilitates both analysis and implementation.

In the following diagram, the big picture and the screens on which this project depends can be seen.
