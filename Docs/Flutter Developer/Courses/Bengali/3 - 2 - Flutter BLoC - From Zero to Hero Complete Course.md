## Description

### Requirements

* Small understanding on how Flutter works

Hello, everyone!

By following this BLoC - From Zero to Hero course, you will successfully learn the **BLoC State Management** solution, so if you have doubts in **understanding** or **practicing** all of its concepts, I really recommend checking it out **right here!**

Before you check it out though, I would like to tell you that this **series** is designed with both the **theoretical** and most importantly, **practical** ( **coding** ) parts of every discussed topic. All of the project files can be found on  **my github page** .

Also, the series was carefully monitored by the amazing creator of bloc_library, Felix Angelov.

On the other hand, without **without the slightest restraint** I feel like my series is **the best bloc_library playlist** on the entire internet.

**Don't take my word for it, try it by yourself!**

A briefing of everything that's been covered in this playlist, so you know what to expect:

1. **Why BLoC?** In this video I explained why I chose bloc_library for both the state management solution and the architectural structure of my apps
2. **BLoC Core Concepts** - In this tutorial I got really in-depth in explaining  **streams** , and the concepts of **blocs** & **cubits.**
3. **Flutter BLoc Concepts** - Here, I discussed each and every single one of bloc_library's concept like **BlocProvider, BlocBuilder, BlocListener** and many many more. These concepts are obviously explained and tested in every tutorial, since they are the base of bloc_library.
4. **BLoC Architecture -** In this tutorial I made a short introduction on what I believe it's the best **architecture** to follow in order to structure and scale your code over time! This video has no code inside my github page, since I'm planning on using it extensively on my follow-up tutorial series on building real world apps!
5. **BLoC Testing** - Testing is one of the most important pillars of programming, oftenly omitted by developers. In this video I'll explain what are the basics of **testing** a bloc-built small application.
6. **BLoC Access & Navigation** - In this tutorial I got really in-depth on what are the **routing options** on which you can successfully provide a cubit/bloc to the widget tree.
7. **Bloc-to-bloc Communication** - Here I wanted all my viewers to understand how important it is to know how to **make 2 blocs/cubit communicate one** with another.
8. **BuildContext In-Depth** - This tutorial is not really related to the bloc_library, but since build contexts are used everywhere inside a flutter app, I realised that most of people didn't understand how they really work. This video is also useful as it spreads out the knowledge gained from  **tutorial number 3 and 6** .
9. **Bloc 6.1.0** - During my tutorial series, a new version of bloc_library got released, containing some important changes like context.watch, context.read and context.select. All of these are covered in this video, as always, with intuitive examples.
10. **Bloc State not Updating** - In this video, I explained why most of the new developers encounter this popular issue of a state of a  **bloc/cubit not updating** .
11. **Maintaining State with Hydrated_Bloc** - In this tutorial I got really in-depth about how you can store the state of multiple blocs/cubits on the app's internal storage on your device. This is a key concept in developing a successful Flutter app, having bloc_library as the state management feature.
12. **Debugging Blocs/Cubits, Naming Conventions and other tips and tricks** is the last video of this series, covering other important topics found inside the flutter_bloc library.

Thank you and hopefully you are as excited as I am!

WCKD
