## Overview

*Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles* by Seth Weidman is a comprehensive resource that guides readers through the foundational concepts of deep learning by constructing neural networks from the ground up using Python and NumPy. The book emphasizes a first-principles approach, ensuring that readers gain a deep understanding of the mathematical and computational underpinnings of neural networks. This methodical construction aids in demystifying complex topics, making them accessible to individuals with a basic background in programming and mathematics.

Throughout the text, Weidman introduces essential deep learning architectures, including multilayer neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Each architecture is explored in detail, with explanations of their theoretical foundations followed by practical implementation examples. By building these models from scratch, readers develop a robust intuition for how different components interact within a neural network, enhancing their ability to design and troubleshoot models in real-world applications.

In addition to foundational architectures, the book delves into advanced topics such as automatic differentiation, optimization techniques, and the implementation of deep learning models using the PyTorch framework. This progression from basic to advanced subjects equips readers with the skills necessary to tackle complex deep learning challenges. By the end of the book, readers will have developed a solid foundation in deep learning principles and practical experience in building and deploying models, positioning them for success in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.
